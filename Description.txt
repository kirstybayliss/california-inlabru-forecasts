This folder contains all neccessary data and code to reproduce the forecasts and figures in "Pseudo-prospective testing of 5-year earthquake forecasts for California using inlabru", Bayliss, Naylor, Kamranzad and Main (submitted 2021).
UCERF3 data downloaded from https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1165/ in June 2019. 
The strain rate model used in this work is available at https://platform.openquake.org/maps/82 and was downloaded in April 2021. 
The exact versions are included in the data folder to ensure future reproducibility.
The Comcat_catalogues folder contains the catalogues used to test the forecasts. The included code downloads these directly, but they are saved here in case of any changes to the catalogue.

California_forecast_inlabru_testing.Rmd is an R-markdown file that runs all steps for model generation and then tests the models with the `pyCSEP' python package using the R package `reticulate'.
inlabru_import_functions.R contains functions to generate the two types of forecast as well as process some of the input data.
pycsep_testing.py runs only the pyCSEP testing using the inlabru forecasts, which are included in the `Forecasts' folder.
The Forecasts folder contains 2 sets of forecasts - those made using 1984-2004 data as in an earlier draft of the paper, and those made using data from 1985-2005 as in the updated draft (May 2022).

Most pacakages can be downloaded directly from CRAN, with the exception of INLA which is using the current (as of December 2021) testing version,
downloaded with `install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"),INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/testing"), dep=TRUE)'
The latest version of inlabru should also be installed using 'remotes::install_github("inlabru-org/inlabru", ref="devel")' 

The forecast models take approx 3 hours each to run fully, including the simulation step and grid-based projections.
